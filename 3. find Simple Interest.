/*Simple interest is a quick method of calculating the interest charge on a loan.
Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the
 principal by the number of days that elapse between payments.

Simple interest formula is given by:

Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
Where,

P is the principal amount
T is the time and
R is the rate*/
